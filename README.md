# Simple-Linear-Regression-with-Sckit-learn
This project demonstrates how to build a Simple Linear Regression model completely from scratch in Python, without using scikit-learn or any machine learning library. It walks through the entire process: loading data, calculating slope and intercept manually, predicting outcomes, evaluating model performance, and visualizing results.
